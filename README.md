# Definition
Bayesâ€™ theorem is a formula that governs how to assign a subjective degree of belief to a hypothesis and rationally update that probability with new evidence. Mathematically, it's the the likelihood of event 

B occurring given that A is true.

This is the fundamental tool and methodology behind Bayesian probability, statistics and programming, as well as the second major form of probability interpretation.

Both frequentist and Bayesian probability have a role to play in machine learning. For example, if dealing with truly random and discrete variables, such as landing a six in a die roll, the traditional approach of simply calculating the odds (frequency) is the fastest way to model a likely outcome. However, if the six keeps coming up far more often than the predicated 1/6 odds, only Bayesian probability would take that new observation into account and increase the confidence level that someone is playing with loaded dice
